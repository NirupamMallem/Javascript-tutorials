If I keep the script file at the top of the html, then i should keep all the event listeners inside an init method
and fire that method only after loading of entire html file. So I need to write an event for that also which is called
'DOMContentLoaded'

I should add this event to document.

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',init)


When you call event.stopPropagation(), it prevents the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
In other words, it stops any further event handlers from being executed on parent elements.
However, it does not prevent the execution of other handlers on the same element.

When you use event.stopImmediatePropagation(), it goes a step further.
It not only prevents propagation to parent elements but also stops other handlers on the same element from executing.
Essentially, it halts all further event handlers for the same event on the current element.

Difference Between Target and Current Traget:
target - It is the element where the eventhandler is actually placed.
currentTarget - when bubbling happens, target becomes the elemnt on which the handler is placed actually and the currentTarget is 
something it got bubbled up.
